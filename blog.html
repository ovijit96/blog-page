                <p>
                    Since returning to the White House in January, US President Donald Trump has threatened and imposed a series of new tariffs.
                </p>
                <p>
                   The tariffs, which target major US trading partners, could upend traditional trading relations, creating significant uncertainty in the global economy.

            <h2>
                New tariff regime
            </h2>
            <p>
                On 2 April, the Trump administration unveiled a new tariff regime that applies a baseline additional tariff of 10% on US imports from all countries. Trump also announced that around 80 countries would face higher tariffs ranging from 10-50%, based on calculations conducted by the administration.</p>

                <p>The tariff regime triggered a global sell-off in equities and US Treasuries, tanking financial markets worldwide. On 9 April, the day the higher tariffs were set to go into effect, Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of the additional tariffs above 10%. Stock markets surged following the reversal.</p>
                
                <p>Trump, however, said that tariffs on China will be raised to 125% effective immediately.</p>
                
                According to the White House, the tariffs are imposed based on presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and will not be additional to existing steel, aluminium and car tariffs imposed previously.
